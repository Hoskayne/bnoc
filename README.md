### BNOC: A benchmarking tool to generate bipartite, k-partite and heterogeneous network models with overlapping communities

**About**

BNOC is a tool for synthesizing bipartite, k-partite and heterogeneous network models with varied features representative of properties from real networks. Multiple input parameters can be manipulated to create networks of varying sizes and with distinct community patterns in terms of number, size, balance, edge distribution intra- and inter-communities, degree of overlapping and cohesion, and degree of noise in the connection patterns.

> To help you visualize networks you can use the [PyNetViewer](https://github.com/alanvalejo/pynetviewer) software.

**Usage**

Parameters `-d`, `-m`, `-c`, `-x`, `-y` and `-z` are arrays of size L, where L is the number of layers.
Parameter `p` is an array of array the probability of vertices in each community for each layer. Parameter `e` define the scheme of the networks, i.e., the connections type.

**Examples**

You can use a config file (.json) to specify the parameters, for instance:

A bipartite network with communities, overlapping and a small level of noise:

	$ python bnoc.py -cnf input/bipartite-1.json

Then, it is possible to plot the network using the PyNetViewer using a bipartite layout. Line widths reflect the
 corresponding edge weights; red squares depict overlapping vertices; and colored circles indicate non-overlapping vertices and their assigned community.
	
    $ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/bipartite-1_layout_1.json

![](img/bipartite-1-layout-1.png)

The same network with standard layout. Only overlapping vertices are highlighted.

    $ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/plot_bipartite-1_layout_2.json
	
![](img/bipartite-1-layout-2.png)

A bipartite network with hard level of noise, unbalanced community sizes and no overlapping.

    $ python bnoc.py -cnf input/bipartite-2.json
    $ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/plot_bipartite-2.json
    
![](img/bipartite-2.png) 
    
A bipartite network with small level of noise, balanced community sizes, no overlapping and many communities.    
    
	$ python bnoc.py -cnf input/bipartite-3.json
	$ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/plot_bipartite-3.json
	
![](img/bipartite-3.png)	
	
A k-partite network with k=4 and overlapping.

	$ python bnoc.py -cnf input/kpartite.json
	$ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/plot_kpartite.json
	
![](img/kpartite.png) 	
	
A heterogeneous network with k=3 layers and no overlapping.
	
	$ python bnoc.py -cnf input/heterogeneous.json
	$ python pynetviewer.py -cnf input/plot_heterogeneous.json

**Scalability**

BNOC can generate large-scale bipartite networks with tens or even hundreds of thousands of vertices and hundreds of millions of edges in a timely manner. See the article for details about complexity and scalability.

Important, save the output files in text format is slow. It is recommended save the result with numpy `.npy` object, see [numpy.save](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.save.html) for details.

For instance, a bipartite network with twenty thousand vertices (use `--show_timing` to print timing values):

    $ python bnoc.py -cnf input/input_bipartite_time_ncol.json

    $        Snippet       Time [m]       Time [s]
    $ Pre-processing            0.0         0.0213
    $     Build BNOC            0.0         2.6187
    $           Save            1.0         34.596

Note, the bottleneck of the Bnoc execution time is to save the output in a text format. To suppress this limitation you can process the network directly in the memory or save a `.npy` object using `--output_npy` or `-onpy` parameter.

    $ python bnoc.py -cnf input/input_bipartite_time_npy.json

    $        Snippet       Time [m]       Time [s]
    $ Pre-processing            0.0         0.0223
    $     Build BNOC            0.0         2.4116
    $           Save            1.0         0.2627

**Install**

> Pip
    
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

> Or Anaconda env

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    $ conda activate bnoc

> Or Anaconda create

    $ conda create --name bnoc python=3.7.2
    $ conda activate bnoc
    $ conda install -c anaconda pyyaml
    $ conda install -c conda-forge pypdf2
    $ conda install -c anaconda scipy

**Testing**

To check that routines are (probably) working properly:

    $ make test

Writing files is tested by exercising the script mode described in the *Usage* section above.
Created objects should probably be better tested, as directions of Bnoc usage.
File I/O can be tested by e.g. appropriatelly replacing the `bnoc.open` function.
